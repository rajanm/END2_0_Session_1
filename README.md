## What is a neural network neuron?
A neuron in a neural network is modelled on the neurons in a human brain. The neuron in the human brain consists of dendrites and synapses. Similarily, a neuron in a neural network receives input data and uses weights and a mathematical function (activation function) to produce an output. This output is passed to the next neuron / layer.

## What is the use of the learning rate?
A learning rate can be considered as one of the hyper parameters for a machine learning model. It can be configurable based on the input data and the use case. This parameter is used by the model to update the weights in steps (learning rate). Generally, the learning rate is kept as a low number.

## How are weights initialized?
Usually, weights are initialized based on some random numbers or seed.

## What is "loss" in a neural network?
Loss is the error in the predictions from the model. Loss is used to calculate gradients. And, it is based on gradients that the weights are updated in each training cycle (epoch).

## What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
Chain rules are used to break down complex mathematical formulae/expressions into smaller components. Each component is calculated to derive the result of the complex expression.
